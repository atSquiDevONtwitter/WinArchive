# WinArchive
WinArchive is a project with the idea of protecting and preserving installers for Windows Apps, like Windows Live 2012, and binaries for older applications with the attempt of running the suite of Windows Vista apps in newer Windows versions. If Microsoft would like to request a takedown, please message me or create a pull request. Thank you!
